# ML4SocialScience
These are the class notes for my course on machine learning for social science (CRIM6012/SOCI6012) that I have taught at the University of Pennsylvania since 2024. The course aims to 
-  build foundational skills essential for machine learning (calculus, linear algebra, probability)
-  cover a range of machine learning methods, primarily supervised learning methods
-  show applications on a range of social science problems
   -  predicting recidivism risk
   -  predicting high school dropout (NELS88)
   -  exploring media censorship (Varieties of Democracy, V-Dem)
   -  studying links between arrest and opiod use (NSDUH)
   -  measure racial disparities in pedestrian stop outcomes
   -  text analysis of officer-involved shooting incident reports
   -  building a *small* language model based only on *Crime and Punishment*

These notes are best viewed at the [ML4SocialScience github.io site](https://gregridgeway.github.io/ML4SocialScience).
